title: Who the hell do you think you are

Here are some reasons you should care what I have to say:

* I once wrote some code.
* It was a traumatic experience and I don't recommend it.

Sometimes I make [indie games](http://stu.scot/wiispace). Other times I make
[electronic music](http://grandfunkdynasty.com). In the daytime I am a
tech-startup wanker coming soon to a disruption near you.

Here are my accounts on

* [Github](http://github.com/grandseiken)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/grandseiken)
* [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/stu-taylor/63/676/692)
* and [Yo](https://www.justyo.co/FATFUCKINGSHITHEAD)

all of which I <del>take extremely seriously</del> only use ironically &#x25A0;
