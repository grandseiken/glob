> "but don't quote me on that"

This is where I will write things, infrequently, and only for the sake of it,
or to annoy my friends, or maybe in case I need to cite it on Wikipedia years
down the line as part of some spectacular long con. Probably the things will
be about programming but don't quote me on that; certainly if there's one thing
the world doesn't have enough of it's programming blogs written by fucking
tubes &#x25A0;
