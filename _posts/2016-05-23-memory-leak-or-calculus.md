title: Memory leak or calculus?
---

I wrote something about explaining resource usage metrics with calculus.

* Here it is [on the blog](https://improbable.io/2016/05/23/memory-leak-just-calculus) of the
  place I work at.
* Here is the [original paper](http://stu.scot/memory_leak_or_calculus.pdf) in PDF format.

Hope you like integrals &#x25A0;
